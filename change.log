I had some dificulties correcting dependencies with the script
So, i added on single bash line on installer script installing the dependecies were missing.
They are: i2p, tor and secure delete
(apt-get install i2p tor secure-delete #Correction for new dependencies, ie, secure-delete)
It fixed my problem
Tested on Kali Linux 2.0 amd64 architecture
