I had some dificulties correcting dependencies with the script
So, i added on single bash line on installer script installing the dependecies were missing.
They are: i2p, tor and secure delete
(apt-get install i2p tor secure-delete #Correction for new dependencies, ie, secure-delete)
It fixed my problem
Since im normaly connected to an IPv6 capable network
i noted sometimes i was IPv6 leaking.
I added the script ipv6_stop.sh.
It disable IPv6 traffic.
When you turn AnonSurf off if you want to enable IPv6 again, just
edit file /etc/sysctl.conf, for  example with gedit (as root)
gedit etc/sysctl.conf
you erase the lines added by the script,save document and then
source /etc/sysctl.conf
when you reboot the machine or network manager, you will be IPv6 capable again
